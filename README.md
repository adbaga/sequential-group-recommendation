# sequential-group-recommendation


<p>This work is based on the assignment that were given on Tampere University's Recommender System class. In this
assignment I implemented the paper "Fair Sequential Group Recommendations" by Maria Stratigi, Jyrki Nummenmaa, Evaggelia Pitoura,
and Kostas Stefanidis and experiment with our modification of the implementation.</p>
